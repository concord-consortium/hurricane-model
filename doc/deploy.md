# Deployment

S3 deployment is handled by GitHub Actions. Pushes are deployed to
`models-resources/hurricane-model/` by the `s3-deploy` job in
[`ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml), and a released version is promoted to the
top-level `index.html` by [`release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml) via
`workflow_dispatch`.

## AWS Access

The GitHub actions in this project are allowed to update files in S3 using OIDC. An
IAM role has been created in AWS with a trust policy that allows GitHub actions in
this specific repository to assume this IAM role. The IAM role has a `RepoName` tag
and a managed policy that uses this tag to give the role's users permission to update
files in `models-resources/[RepoName]`.

See
[deploy-setup.md in starter-projects](https://github.com/concord-consortium/starter-projects/blob/main/doc/deploy-setup.md)
for how the AWS side is set up.
